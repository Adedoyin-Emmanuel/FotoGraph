### Introduction

Fotograph is an open source powerful image manipulation software with a variety of tools for image conversion, bulk image downloading, AI-based image generation, background removal, image resizing, and compression.

FotoGraph brings most image manipulation tools we use online to a single offline application that works on all operating systems,

### Installation

Fotograph is available for Linux and Windows but not Mac :(

#### Linux Installation

To install on linux, you can download the .deb file from
https://fotograph.vercel.app/download or download the files from the release on github
then run

```bash
cd Downloads
sudo dpkg -i Fotograph_1.0.0_amd64.deb
```

#### Windows Installation

To install on windows,visit https://fotograph.vercel.app/download or download the files from the release on github
then just run the Fotograph.Setup.1.0.0.exe, it would setup Fotograph and create a shortcut on your desktop

#### Mac Installation

To install on Mac, you would have to build it yourself, I can't package for mac OS because I don't have one :(
To do that, simply clone this project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adedoyin-Emmanuel/Fotograph.git

cd Fotograph

npm install

npm run package -- --mac

```

Viola, you have Fotograph on your macbook, now run

```bash
cd release/build
```

You should see the setup for your mac OS

### Alternatively

You can also run the .appimage on your Linux distro,
